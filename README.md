### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Typescript, Node, AWS, React, MongoDB.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go.
- 👯 I’m also working on(learning) creating Design Systems in react.
- 🤔 I want to create a real-time rich text editor that works in the browser.

### Here are some of the values that I live by ⛄️

- 👨🏻 Software Engineering is more about interacting with people than with code.
- 😇 Empathy and Humbleness are the two most important skills ~for any role~ for any person.
- 👀 Developer experience is equally important as User experience. If your users are happy but the developers aren't that means you're doing something wrong.
- 🧐 Code Reviews should be encouraging. People should be excited about a code review session with you and not feel hesitant.
- 💪🏻 Your team's success is your success. Help people grow. That shit feels good!.
- 🍜 Having side passions or hobbies helps you feel good when you need a break from work. Mine are cooking 🍪 & traveling 🚘.
- 🏃🏻 Health, Life, Family >>>>>>>> Work.
- 🎭 People >>>>>>>> Software.
