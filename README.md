### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Typescript, Node, AWS, React, MongoDB.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go.
- 👯 I’m also working on(learning) creating Design Systems in react.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with learning creating a real-time rich text editor in browsers.

#### Here are some of the values that I live by ⛄️

- 🎩 Software Engineering is more about interacting with people than with code.
- 😇 Empathy and Humbleness are the two most important skills for any role.
- 👀 Developer Experience is equally important as User Experience. If your users are happy but your devs aren't that means you're failing at it.
- 🧐 A Code Review should be encouraging, engaging with thoughtful discussions. Devs should be excited about a code review session with you and not feel hesitant.
- 😌 Your team's success is your success. Help people grow. That shit feels good!.
- 🍜 Having side passions or hobbies helps you feel good when you need a break from coding. Mine are cooking 🍪 & traveling 🚘.
- ✅ Health, Life, Family >>>>>>>> Work.
- ✅ People >>>>>>>> Software.
