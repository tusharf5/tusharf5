# Hey, I'm Tushar! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working on Serverless, Typescript, Golang, Node, AWS, React. I like learning and building stuff related to databases & browsers.

## In my free time

- I love reading about and looking at pictures of space.
- I love trekking mountains.
- Nowadays, I am learning linux networking internals, working on a react drag & drop lib.

## My values

- Software engineering has more to do with people than with code.
- Empathy is one of the most important skills for any role.
- Developer experience is equally important as user experience. If your users are happy but the developers are not that means you're doing something wrong.
- Your team's success is your success. Help people grow. That shit feels good!.
- Try to read this page with your eyes closed. Can't do it right? Unfortunately, some people have to do it like that. Thus, it is our responsibility as web developers to make sure the web pages we create are accessible to those people.
- Having side passions or hobbies helps you feel good when you need a break from work. Mine are space & traveling ðŸš˜.
- Health, Happiness & Respect >>>>>>> Work.
- People over Processes.
