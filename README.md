# Hey, I'm Tushar! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working on Serverless, Typescript, Golang, Node, AWS, React. I like learning and building stuff related to databases & browsers.

## In my free time

- I love reading about space, trekking mountains.
- Nowadays, I am learning more about the working of linux networking stack, ~~working on a react drag & drop lib~~.
