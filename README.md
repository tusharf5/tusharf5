### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Typescript, Node, AWS, React, MongoDB.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go.
- 👯 I’m also working on(learning) creating Design Systems in react.
- 🤔 I want to create a real-time rich text editor that works in the browser.

### Here are some of the values that I live by ⛄️

- 👨🏻 Software Engineering is more about interacting with people than with code.
- 😇 Empathy and Humbleness are the two most important skills ~for any role~ for any person.
- 👀 Developer experience is equally important as User experience. If your users are happy but the developers are not that means you're doing something wrong.
- 🧐 Code Reviews should be encouraging. People should be excited about a code review session with you and not feel hesitant.
- 💪🏻 Your team's success is your success. Help people grow. That shit feels good!.
- 🦋 Try to read this page with your eyes closed. Can't do it right? Unfortunately, some people have to do it like that. Thus, it is our responsibility as web developers to make sure the web pages we create are accessible to people with disabilities.
- 🍜 Having side passions or hobbies helps you feel good when you need a break from work. Mine are cooking 🍪 & traveling 🚘.
- 🏃🏻 Health, Happiness, Family >>>>>>>> Work.
- 🎭 People >>>>>>>> Software.
