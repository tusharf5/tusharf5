# Hey, I'm Tushar! 👋

I'm the director of engineering at Gerald Technologies, Inc. I’m currently working on Typescript, Node, AWS, React, MongoDB. I like learning and building stuff related to databases & browsers.

## In my free time

- I enjoy cooking 👨🏻‍🍳
- I love traveling to mountains.
- Nowadays, I am learning Golang.
- I’m also working on(learning) creating design systems in react.

## My values

- Software engineering is more about interacting with people than with code.
- Empathy is one of the most important skills ~for any role~ for anyone.
- Developer experience is equally important as user experience. If your users are happy but the developers are not that means you're doing something wrong.
- Your team's success is your success. Help people grow. That shit feels good!.
- Try to read this page with your eyes closed. Can't do it right? Unfortunately, some people have to do it like that. Thus, it is our responsibility as web developers to make sure the web pages we create are accessible to those people.
- Having side passions or hobbies helps you feel good when you need a break from work. Mine are cooking 🍪 & traveling 🚘.
- Health, Happiness, Family >>>>>>>> Work.
- People >>>>>>>> Software.
